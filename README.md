# WordleVariant
I tried making Wordle in Pycharm. Hope you like it!
Though, it only works in the "Run" section because i used termcolor for letter coloring. Or in the Terminal.

Try one of two Word lists: The original Wordle list (more than 10 000 words) with one extra custom word, or the alternative: my word list constisting of 42 words.
